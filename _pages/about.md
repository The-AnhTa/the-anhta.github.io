I am a researcher at the Information Security Division, KDDI Research Institute, Inc. in Saitama, Japan since 10/2022. I do research on Machine Learning and Cryptography. In Machine Learning, I am mainly interested in Continual Learning for Segmantic Segmentation, Geometry and Topology of Data and Neural Network Pruning; while in Cryptography, I focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Lattices.

Short bio
------
From 05/2021 to 07/2022, I was an AI Scientist at AI Center, FPT Software, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France on 09/2020. Before moving to France in 2016, I did my undergraduate studies (BSc+MSc) in Mathematics at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary from 2011 to 2016. I am from Vinh Phuc, Viet Nam.

Cryptography
------
Currently, my research focuses on Fully Homomorphic Encryption and their applications in Secure Computation. In addition, I am also interested in Digital Signatures and Lattice-base Protocols.
