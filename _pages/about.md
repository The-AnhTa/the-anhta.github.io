Hello, my name is The-Anh Ta (Tạ Thế Anh in Vietnamese). Since 8/2023, I have been working as a Research Scientist at Data61, The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Marsfield, NSW, Australia. I do research in AI Algorithms and AI Safety (Robust and Adaptive Machine Learning Algorithms, Continual Learning, Decision Making, Backdoor Attacks and Defenses) and Privacy-Enhancing Technology (Applied Cryptography, Zero-knowledge Proof, Digital Signature, Data Privacy), and problems at the intersection of these areas. This is the link to [my GoogleScholar page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=1y0vv1wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

Before moving to Australia, I was a core researcher at the Information Security Group, KDDI Research Institute, Inc. in Saitama, Japan, from 11/2022 until 5/2023; and an AI Scientist, Solution Architect and AI Residency Mentor at AI Center, FPT Software, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from 05/2021 to 07/2023.

I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the Paris-Saclay University, Orsay, France on 06/2021 [(Link to my thesis)](https://www.theses.fr/2020UPASM007). 
Before moving to France in 2016, I did my undergraduate studies (BSc and MSc) in Mathematics at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary, from 2011 to 2016. 

I grew up in [Vinh Phuc, Viet Nam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%A9nh_Ph%C3%BAc_province).

Machine Learning:
------
I am interested in AI Safety and in building robust and adaptive algorithms which can adapt to ever changing working environments.
