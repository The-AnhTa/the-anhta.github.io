Hello, my name is The-Anh Ta (Tạ Thế Anh in Vietnamese). I do research in Machine Learning (continual learning, robustness, efficiency) and Cryptography (digital signatures, secure computation, data privacy), and problems at the intersection of these areas [my GoogleScholar page](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=1y0vv1wAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). 

From 11/2022 until 5/2023, I was a researcher at the Information Security Division, KDDI Research Institute, Inc. in Saitama, Japan.
From 05/2021 to 07/2023, I was an AI Scientist at AI Center, FPT Software, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 

I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France on 09/2020 [(Link to my thesis)](https://www.theses.fr/2020UPASM007). 
Before moving to France in 2016, I did my undergraduate studies (BSc+MSc) in Mathematics at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary from 2011 to 2016. 
I grew up in [Vinh Phuc, Viet Nam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%A9nh_Ph%C3%BAc_province).

Cryptography:
------
I have been working on designing Digital Signatures and Fully Homomorphic Encryption.
