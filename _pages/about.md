I am a researcher at the Information Security Division, KDDI Research Institute, Inc. in Saitama, Japan since 11/2022. I do research on Machine Learning and Cryptography. In Machine Learning, I am mainly interested in Continual Learning, Geometry and Topology of Data, and Neural Network Pruning; while in Cryptography, I focus on Fully Homomorphic Encryption, and Digital Signature.

From 05/2021 to 07/2022, I was an AI Scientist at AI Center, FPT Software, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. 
I obtained my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Paris-Saclay, Orsay, France on 09/2020 [(Link to my thesis)](https://www.theses.fr/2020UPASM007). 
Before moving to France in 2016, I did my undergraduate studies (BSc+MSc) in Mathematics at the Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest, Hungary from 2011 to 2016. 
I am from [Vinh Phuc, Viet Nam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%A9nh_Ph%C3%BAc_province).

Cryptography:
------
Currently, my research focuses on Fully Homomorphic Encryption and their applications in Secure Computation. In addition, I am also interested in Digital Signatures and Lattices.
